## 0) Quick Start: Verify Your Current Python & Pip
Use this to see what's already installed.

```python
import sys, platform, subprocess, shutil
print("Python executable:", sys.executable)
print("Python version:", sys.version)
print("Platform:", platform.platform())
```

```text
Python executable: c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-venv\Scripts\python.exe
Python version: 3.13.8 (tags/v3.13.8:a15ae61, Oct  7 2025, 12:34:25) [MSC v.1944 64 bit (AMD64)]
Platform: Windows-11-10.0.26100-SP0
```

```python
def which(cmd):
    return shutil.which(cmd) or "<not found>"

print("pip:", which("pip"))
print("conda:", which("conda"))
print("mamba:", which("mamba"))
print("python:", which("python"))
print("py:", which("py"))  # Windows launcher
```

```text
pip: c:\Users\yonas\Documents\ICPAC\python-ml-gha-venv\Scripts\pip.EXE
conda: <not found>
mamba: <not found>

## 1) Conda Distributions: **Anaconda**, **Miniconda**, **Miniforge**, **Mambaforge**

Choose one of these Conda-based options:

- **Anaconda** (full): Large installer including hundreds of data-science packages, **Anaconda Navigator** GUI, and `conda`. Uses the **defaults** channel by default. Good for offline/enterprise labs.
- **Miniconda** (minimal Anaconda): Small installer with just `conda` and Python. Uses **defaults** by default; you add packages as needed. Lightweight and flexible.
- **Miniforge** (community): Minimal installer that defaults to the **conda-forge** channel (huge community repo with very fresh builds). Great for scientific/geo/ML stacks.
- **Mambaforge**: Miniforge + `mamba` preinstalled (a much faster solver). Recommended if you want speed and conda‑forge by default.


- Choose **one** approach per OS. 
- **Miniforge/Mambaforge** is usually the smoothest because it provides prebuilt packages.

## 2) Package Managers: `conda` vs `pip`
**Conda/mamba** manage Python _and_ non-Python deps (e.g., `gdal`, `geos`, `cuda`). **Pip** installs Python packages from PyPI.

### Conda / Mamba Basics
```bash
conda init            # set up your shell once
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda create -n ds-312 python=3.12
conda activate ds-312
conda install numpy pandas jupyterlab
conda list
conda env export > environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda remove --name ds-312
conda remove -n ds-312
conda remove
```

Deactivate:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### Pip Basics
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas jupyterlab
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3) Create & Activate Virtual Environments

- When installing Python on your machine, you have the option to install it `system-wide` or in a `virtual environment`.

- Installing Python system-wide may seem like the most straightforward approach, it can lead to several problems such as `dependency conflicts` and `version conflicts`.

- Installing Python in a virtual environment provides several benefits such as `Isolation`, `Dependency management`, and `Reproducibility`.

- A `virtual environment` is an `isolated Python environment` that allows you to `manage dependencies` for different `projects` without conflicts.

- Below are step-by-step guides for creating virtual environments using Conda and pip.

### A) Conda 
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.11
conda activate myenv
conda install numpy
```
Deactivate:
```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Python Environment management with pip
- Python Default Package Manager: pip is the standard/default package manager for Python.

- Lightweight: Designed for Python-only projects and lightweight environments.

- Virtual Environment Support: Works with venv or virtualenv to create isolated environments.

- Ease of Use: Simple syntax for installing and managing packages.

- Community Driven: Extensive library ecosystem supported by the Python community.

- Customizable Requirements: Supports dependency management with requirements.txt files.

### B) Built-in `venv` (works everywhere)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux (bash)
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy

```
Deactivate: `deactivate`
