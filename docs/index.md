# Climate-Driven Malaria Modeling with VECTRI

**One-Week Training Workshop**

<span class="workshop-date">📅 December 15–19, 2025</span>

</div>

## Overview

This training is designed to help participants understand how climate-driven malaria modeling using VECTRI can be used to enhance malaria early warning systems and support evidence-based public health interventions in Ethiopia. In particular, this training is prepared in collaboration between the **Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)** and **Addis Ababa University (AAU)** to support participants from the **Ethiopian Meteorological Institute (EMI)**. 

It will cover both foundational concepts and hands-on practical applications using real-world data from the Amhara region. This training is financed by the **Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)** as part of the **Water and Climate Change Services for Africa, Ethiopia (WACCA-E), phase 2** project.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

1. Source, quality check, and preprocess ERA5/CHIRPS climate data into daily, VECTRI-ready NetCDF format (rainfall, 2-m temperature)
2. Compile and run VECTRI; interpret outputs (EIR - Entomological Inoculation Rate, HBR - Human Biting Rate, cases) and evaluate lags (EIR→cases)
3. Understand the biological basis of malaria transmission and how climate variables drive vector and parasite dynamics
4. Create environmental input files (population, land cover) for VECTRI modeling
5. Conduct spatial and temporal analysis of model outputs to identify malaria transmission hotspots and seasonal patterns
6. Prototype a simple early-warning workflow for Amhara's Kiremt/Belg seasonality
7. Communicate findings effectively for public health decision-making
