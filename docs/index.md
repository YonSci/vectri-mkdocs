# Climate-Driven Malaria Modeling with VECTRI

**Dates:** Monday–Friday, **15–19 December 2025**  
**Time:** 09:00–17:00 (UTC+03:00, Africa/Addis_Ababa)  
**Format:** Lectures + hands-on labs (≈60% practical)  
**Audience:** NMHSs, Ministries of Health, research institutes, universities (East Africa focus)  
**Lead trainer:** Yonas Mersha

> **Goal:** Build an end-to-end pipeline: climate data → VECTRI setup → runs → calibration/validation → seasonal outlooks/scenarios → decision products (maps/dashboards/briefs).

## Learning outcomes
- Explain climate–malaria pathways and VECTRI outputs (EIR, vector density, incidence).
- Acquire & preprocess climate/population/admin data for VECTRI.
- Configure, run, and troubleshoot VECTRI; interpret outputs.
- Calibrate & validate with HMIS/DHIS2 or DHS/MIS; quantify skill & uncertainty.
- Produce seasonal outlooks/IBF-style alerts and a lightweight dashboard.

## Daily structure (quick glance)
- **Day 1:** Foundations & data pipeline (CHIRPS, ERA5-Land; preprocessing & EDA)
- **Day 2:** VECTRI configuration & baseline runs
- **Day 3:** Calibration, validation & sensitivity
- **Day 4:** Forecasting, scenarios & uncertainty
- **Day 5:** Decision products, communication & capstone

!!! info "Deliverables"
    By Day 5, teams produce a mini-dashboard, a 2-page brief, and a slide with key findings.
